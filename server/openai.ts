Workflow: ${workflowName}
Steps: ${JSON.stringify(workflowSteps, null, 2)}

Create a comprehensive workflow analysis report in markdown format with these sections:

1. **Executive Summary**: Brief overview of main findings and recommendations in simple language
2. **Current Process Overview**: What happens now in this workflow, step by step
3. **Key Issues Identified**: Problems causing delays, frustration, or inefficiency
4. **Time and Cost Analysis**: How long each step takes and estimated costs
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Why these problems exist (include a simple cause-and-effect diagram in text format)
6. **Recommended Improvements**: Specific solutions to fix the problems
7. **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step guide to make changes
8. **Expected Benefits**: Time saved, costs reduced, patient satisfaction improved
9. **Success Metrics**: How to measure if improvements are working
10. **Sustainability Plan**: How to maintain improvements long-term
11. **Visual Process Flow**: Create a simple before/after process diagram using text/ASCII art

IMPORTANT FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear headings with ## for sections
- Include simple text-based diagrams that display properly in markdown
- For process flows, use arrows and boxes like: [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Decision?] → [Step 3]
- For cause-and-effect, use indented lists with clear categories
- Include specific numbers: times, costs, percentages
- Write for healthcare staff who want practical solutions, not academic theory
- Make diagrams that render correctly in HTML/markdown viewers
- DO NOT use asterisks for bold formatting - use plain text for emphasis instead
- Avoid markdown bold syntax like **text** - just use regular text

Focus on practical, actionable recommendations with real healthcare examples.

CRITICAL: Include visual diagrams using simple text formatting:
- For process flows: [Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Decision Point] → [Step 3] → [End]
- For cause-and-effect analysis, use tree structure with simple characters
- For timelines: Week 1 → Week 2 → Week 3 → Implementation Complete
- Use code blocks with triple backticks for complex diagrams

Make all diagrams clear and visually appealing when rendered in HTML.`;

## 1. Executive Summary

This analysis of your ${workflowName} identifies key opportunities to improve efficiency and patient experience. The current ${stepCount}-step process can be streamlined to save time and reduce frustration for both staff and patients.

Key Findings:
- Time Savings Potential: ${timeSaved} minutes per patient
- Efficiency Improvement: ${efficiency}%
- Implementation Time: 2-3 months
- Expected Return: Significant cost savings and better patient satisfaction
- Quality Impact: More consistent, predictable service

## 2. Current Process Overview

What Happens Now: Your ${workflowName} currently follows ${stepCount} main steps, but several bottlenecks are slowing things down.

Main Problems:
- Patients wait longer than necessary between steps
- Staff spend time on tasks that could be automated
- Information gets lost or needs to be re-entered
- Some steps happen out of order, causing delays

Goal: Speed up the process by ${efficiency}% while making it easier for staff and more pleasant for patients.

## 3. Project Scope

**In Scope:**
- All ${stepCount} process steps from initiation to completion
- Staff roles and responsibilities within the workflow
- Current technology and tools used
- Quality checkpoints and measurements
- Patient touchpoints and interactions

**Out of Scope:**
- IT infrastructure changes requiring >6 months implementation
- Policy changes requiring executive approval
- External vendor processes
- Regulatory compliance modifications

## 4. Define Phase

### Project Charter
**Business Case:** Optimization of ${workflowName} to improve operational efficiency and patient satisfaction while reducing costs.

**Stakeholders:**
- Process owners and operators
- Department management
- Quality assurance team
- Patient experience coordinators

### SIPOC Analysis
**Suppliers:** ${workflowSteps[0]?.text || 'Initial inputs'}
**Inputs:** Patient information, scheduling data, clinical requirements
**Process:** ${stepCount}-step workflow from ${workflowSteps[0]?.text || 'start'} to ${workflowSteps[stepCount-1]?.text || 'completion'}
**Outputs:** Completed service delivery, documentation, patient satisfaction
**Customers:** Patients, healthcare providers, administrative staff

## 5. Measure Phase

### Current State Metrics
**Current Process Flow:**
\`\`\`
${workflowSteps.map(step => `[${step.text}]`).join(' → ')}
\`\`\`

**Process Steps with Details:**
${workflowSteps.map((step, i) => `${i + 1}. ${step.text} - ${step.type === 'start' ? 'Starting point' : step.type === 'end' ? 'Final step' : step.type === 'decision' ? 'Decision point' : 'Process step'}`).join('\n')}

**Baseline Measurements:**

## 6. Analyze Phase

### Root Cause Analysis

**Fishbone Analysis - Key Categories:**
- **People:** Training gaps, role clarity issues
- **Process:** Unclear procedures, handoff delays
- **Equipment:** Technology limitations, outdated tools
- **Environment:** Physical layout inefficiencies
- **Materials:** Information delays, incomplete data

**5-Why Analysis:**
1. Why do delays occur? → Waiting between process steps
2. Why is there waiting? → Unclear handoff procedures
3. Why are procedures unclear? → Lack of standardization

4. **Cross-training Program** - Increase staff flexibility and coverage
5. **Technology Integration** - Streamline data entry and tracking
6. **Quality Checkpoints** - Implement real-time quality controls

**Strategic Initiatives (2-3 months):**
7. **Process Automation** - Automate routine administrative tasks
8. **Performance Dashboard** - Real-time metrics and monitoring
9. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular kaizen events and reviews

### Implementation Plan

- **Revenue Enhancement:** $${(efficiency * 1000).toLocaleString()} (increased throughput)
- **Quality Improvement:** $${(stepCount * 5000).toLocaleString()} (reduced rework/errors)

**Total Annual Impact:** $${((timeSaved * 50 * 250) + (efficiency * 1000) + (stepCount * 5000)).toLocaleString()}
**Implementation Cost:** $${(stepCount * 2000).toLocaleString()}
**Net ROI:** ${Math.round(((timeSaved * 50 * 250) + (efficiency * 1000) + (stepCount * 5000)) / (stepCount * 2000) * 100)}%

## Executive Summary
This workflow analysis identifies key optimization opportunities using Lean Six Sigma methodology. Current process contains ${stepCount} steps with potential for significant improvement.

**Key Metrics:**
- Estimated Time Savings: ${timeSaved} minutes per cycle
- Efficiency Improvement: ${efficiency}%
- Implementation Timeline: 2-4 weeks

## Problem Definition (TIMWOODS Analysis)
**Current State Issues:**
- **Transportation**: Unnecessary movement between steps
- **Inventory**: Potential bottlenecks in process flow
- **Motion**: Redundant actions in workflow
- **Waiting**: Delays between process steps
- **Over-processing**: Possible redundant activities
- **Over-production**: Resource allocation inefficiencies
- **Defects**: Quality control gaps
- **Skills**: Training opportunities identified

## Root Cause Analysis (5-Why Method)
1. **Why** do delays occur? → Lack of standardized procedures
2. **Why** are procedures not standardized? → Inconsistent training
3. **Why** is training inconsistent? → No formal training program
4. **Why** is there no formal program? → Resource allocation priorities
5. **Why** are resources not allocated? → Limited process documentation

## Current vs Future State

### Current State:
${workflowSteps.map((step, i) => `${i + 1}. ${step.text} (${step.type})`).join('\n')}

### Future State Improvements:
- Streamlined handoffs between steps
- Automated data collection where possible
- Standardized procedures and checklists
- Real-time progress tracking
- Quality checkpoints integrated

## Improvement Opportunities (Priority Ranked)

### High Impact (Quick Wins)
1. **Standardize Procedures** - Create detailed SOPs for each step
2. **Eliminate Waiting** - Implement parallel processing where possible
3. **Reduce Motion** - Optimize physical workspace layout

### Medium Impact
4. **Automate Data Entry** - Reduce manual transcription errors
5. **Cross-train Staff** - Improve workflow flexibility
6. **Implement Visual Controls** - Status boards and progress indicators

### Long-term Strategic
7. **Technology Integration** - Electronic workflow management
8. **Continuous Improvement** - Regular kaizen events
9. **Performance Metrics** - Real-time dashboard implementation

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1-2: Foundation
- Document current state processes
- Identify key stakeholders
- Establish baseline metrics

### Week 3-4: Quick Wins
- Implement standardized procedures
- Optimize workspace layout
- Begin staff cross-training

### Month 2-3: Technology Integration
- Deploy workflow management tools
- Implement automated tracking
- Establish performance dashboards

## Success Metrics and Control Plan

**Primary KPIs:**
- Cycle Time Reduction: Target ${timeSaved} minutes
- Process Efficiency: Target ${efficiency}% improvement
- Error Rate: Reduce by 50%
- Staff Satisfaction: Maintain >90%

**Control Methods:**
- Weekly performance reviews
- Monthly process audits
- Quarterly stakeholder feedback
- Annual process optimization review

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**High Risk:**
- Staff resistance to change
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive change management plan

**Medium Risk:**
- Technology integration challenges
  - *Mitigation*: Phased implementation approach

**Low Risk:**
- Resource availability
  - *Mitigation*: Flexible timeline and resource allocation

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a structured approach to optimizing the ${workflowName} process using proven Lean Six Sigma methodologies. Expected outcomes include significant time savings, improved efficiency, and enhanced quality control.`;

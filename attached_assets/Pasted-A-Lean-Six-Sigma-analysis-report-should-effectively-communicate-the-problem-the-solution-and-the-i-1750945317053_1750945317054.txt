A Lean Six Sigma analysis report should effectively communicate the problem, the solution, and the impact of a project. It should follow a structured format, typically based on the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology, and include a clear problem statement, data analysis, root cause identification, proposed solutions, and a plan for sustaining improvements. Visual aids and data metrics are crucial for demonstrating the project's success and return on investment. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown of what a Lean Six Sigma analysis report should include:
1. Executive Summary: 
A concise overview of the entire project, highlighting the key findings, recommendations, and the overall impact.
This should be written in a way that is easily understandable for stakeholders who may not be familiar with Six Sigma.
2. Problem Statement: 
A clear and concise description of the problem being addressed, including the process affected, the current performance, and the desired outcome.
The problem statement should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
3. Project Scope: 
Defines the boundaries of the project, specifying what is included and excluded.
This helps to manage expectations and ensure focus.
4. Define Phase: 
Includes a project charter, outlining the problem, its impact, and the goals of the project.
May include a SIPOC diagram (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers) to define the scope of the process.
5. Measure Phase: 
Describes the data collection methods used to establish a baseline for the process.
Includes process maps, control charts, and other relevant data visualization tools to illustrate the current state.
6. Analyze Phase:
Presents the analysis of the data collected, identifying the root causes of the problem. 
Includes fishbone diagrams (also known as cause-and-effect diagrams), Pareto charts, and other statistical tools to pinpoint the underlying issues. 
7. Improve Phase: 
Details the proposed solutions to address the root causes of the problem.
Includes brainstorming sessions, pilot testing, and implementation plans for the chosen solutions.
8. Control Phase: 
Outlines the plan for sustaining the improvements achieved.
Includes control charts, standard operating procedures, and training materials to ensure the process remains stable.
9. Financial Impact: 
Quantifies the financial benefits of the project, such as cost savings, increased revenue, or improved efficiency.
This helps to demonstrate the return on investment and justify the project's implementation.
10. Lessons Learned: 
Reflects on the project's successes and challenges, identifying areas for improvement in future projects.
This helps to build a knowledge base for future Lean Six Sigma initiatives.
11. Visual Aids: 
Use graphs, charts, and other visuals to effectively communicate data and results.
Visual aids can help stakeholders understand the project's progress and impact more easily.
